## What is a Schulte Table?

A Schulte table is a simple grid of randomly arranged numbers (commonly 1–25).
The task is to find the numbers in ascending order as quickly as possible.

It’s a widely used method to:

-   Improve concentration and focus
-   Develop peripheral vision
-   Increase reading speed and eye movement efficiency

Originally developed for psychology and pedagogy, it is widely used to improve peripheral vision, concentration, speed of visual perception, and reading skills.
